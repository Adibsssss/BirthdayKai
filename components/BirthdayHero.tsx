/**
 * The section's aspect ratio is locked to the artwork's own aspect ratio
 * (2400x1792, ~4:3). That's the key fix: previously the section's height
 * was driven purely by its content (photo + headline + paragraph), so on
 * a narrow phone it ended up much taller and skinnier than the artwork
 * was drawn for -- forcing `object-cover` to crop away most of the left
 * and right balloon columns just to fill that shape. Locking the aspect
 * ratio means the card is always proportioned like the artwork itself, on
 * any phone width, so the same amount of balloon shows every time (this
 * is why the wide-screenshot version looked right: at that width the
 * section's natural aspect ratio happened to already be close to 4:3).
 *
 * Content sizing below (photo/headline/paragraph) is tuned to fit inside
 * that aspect-locked height at common phone widths (~360-430px). If a
 * device renders the headline on three lines instead of two, the box will
 * grow slightly taller than the strict ratio (CSS aspect-ratio yields to
 * content rather than clipping it) -- a small amount of extra side-crop
 * in that edge case, not breakage.
